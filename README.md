Who hasn't played the dinosaur game in Chrome when the internet goes down? But how about with Touch Bar?

TouchBarDinoX extends [TouchBarDino](https://github.com/yuhuili/TouchBarDino) with a new leaderboard system. At the end of the game, the app communicates with the [TouchBarDinoX-Server](https://github.com/yuhuili-lab/TouchBarDinoX-Server) and displays the ranking.

## The original TouchBarDino
TouchBarDino is a macOS app that simulates the dinosaur running game on the Touch Bar. It is written in Swift 3 and uses SpriteKit.
